This week you will use ggplot2 to explore fish datasets.  You will be looking for outliers and examining the distributions of density in different habitat types.  

Inspect the fish_psu_density.csv dataset.  These data are density of 5 individual species at each sample site collected over three years in 2 different regions (NCRMP and DCRMP).

  
### Part 1 Box Plots

1. Create box and whisker plots, grouped by YEAR, REGION, STRAT and SPECIES_CD, to plot mean species' density.  
    - Use both fish_psu_density.csv & fish_psu_density_w_outliers.csv.  They are identical except for a few outliers in the data.
    
2. Create another set of box and whisker plots like #1 except split the box plots by REGION (all the species in NCRMP and all the species in DCRMP, separately).  Hint: Faceting


### Part 2 Scatter Plots

3. Create a scatter plot of STRAT-level mean density vs. standard deviation.  Each point on the plot will represent a single species mean density vs sd in every STRAT.  For this plot you can aggregate all the years together to get a better understanding of STRAT-level variance.
    - How would you interpret this plot?

4. Create another scatter plot like #3 using the fish_psu_density_w_outliers dataset to see how outliers affect the plots.

### Part 3 Histograms

Inspect the length_frequency.csv dataset.  This data represents two fish's relative length frequency in 1cm size bins.  

5.  Using the length_frequency.csv, create a length frequency histogram (in 1cm size bins).  Both species should be on the same plot so you can compare their relative population size compositions.  Hint:  You will likely need to pivot the data first.

Lastly, the usvi_2021_raw.csv dataset represents raw counts that divers observed in their sample.  One way to check for errors in a dataset like this is to plot a histogram of the raw numbers to visually check if something looks off.  

6. Create a histogram for each species present in the dataset showing the distribution of NUMBER_OF_INDIVIDUALS.
