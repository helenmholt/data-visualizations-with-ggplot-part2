This week we will continue working with the STEER bathymetric raster dataset.

This weeks exercise is going to be tricky.  You will need to use the tools learned today as well as use tools previously learned.

***Again, the solution cannot be solved in one step.  It will take many steps to reach the final product.  I would advice to think through the problem first, and perhaps write down the workflow on paper.***  


### Finding a novel algae toxin

Pretend a new toxic algae was discovered.  Toxins found in the algae have been linked to a coral disease.  Prior research has shown that the algae thrives best on...

    1. Southern facing habitats (135 < degrees < 225).
    2. Moderate to high sloping areas (>= 10 degrees).
    3. In depths between 12 and 15 meters.

Using the STEER Bathymetric dataset, create a single shapefile showing where all the above criteria are met.  This will be the areas you would recommend for eradication.
